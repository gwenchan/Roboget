About=DISM++ is a utility for advanced users to clean, slim, backup, update or recover your Windows operating system.Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe) is a command-line tool that can be used to service a Windows image or to prepare a Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) image. Dism++ does not depend on Microsoft DISM and is based directly on the lower-level CBS (Component Based Servicing Reference). Essentially it adds a Graphical User Image (GUI) to what most know as DISM to make it easier for the end user to use.
